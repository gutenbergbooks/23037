<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">Violets!</span> Violets! Violets!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the cry I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I passed through the street of a city;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quickly my heart was stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To an incomprehensible pity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the undertone of the cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it seemed like the voice of one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was stricken, and all undone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was only longing to die.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Violets! Violets! Violets!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice came nearer still.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And out on valley and hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The violets blooming to-day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Children of sun and of dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flakes of the blue of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is somebody calling to you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who seems to be longing to die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet violets are so sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They can scarcely have dealings with death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can it be, that the dying breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That comes from the one last beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a true heart, turns to the flowers?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Violets! Violets! Violets!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crier is near me at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my eyes I am holding her fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is a lovely seller of flowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is one whom the town devours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In its jaws of bustle and strife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How poverty grinds down a life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, lost in the slime of a city,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For loveliness in disgrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet she that I hold with my eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who seems so modest and wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has not yet fallen, I am sure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has nobly learned to endure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Large, and mournful, and meek,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span><span class="i0">Her eyes seem to drink from my own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her curls are carelessly thrown<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And her lips seem strawberries, lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some Arctic country of frost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slightest curve on a face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May give an expression unmeet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet hers is so perfect and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shaped with such delicate grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its loveliness is complete.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Violets! Violets! Violets!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hear the cry once more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not as I heard it before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It whispers no more of death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But only of odorous breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And modest flowers, and life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I purchased a cluster, so rife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the touch of her tapering hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seem to hold it in mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would I could understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why a touch seems so divine.<br /></span>

A FLOWER FOUND IN THE STREET.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To-day in passing down the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I found a flower upon the walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dear syringa, white and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wrung idly from the missing stalk.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And something in its odor speaks<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of dark brown eyes, and arms of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rainbow smiles on sunset cheeks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The maid I saw a month ago.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I waited for her many a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the dear ground where first we met;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought her up and down the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all in vain I seek her yet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Syringa, naught your odor tells,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or whispers so I cannot hear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak out, and tell me where she dwells,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In perfume accents, loud and clear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shake out the music of your speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In quavers of delicious breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The conscious melody may teach<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A lover where love wandereth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If so you speak, with smile and look,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You will not wither, but endure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my heart's still open book,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Keep your white petals ever pure.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If so you speak, upon her breast<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You yet may rest, nor sigh afar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the moonlight's silver dressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Seem 'gainst your heaven the evening star.<br /></span>

ODYLE.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We know that they are often near<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of whom we think, of whom we talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though we have missed them many a year,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And lost them from our daily walk.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some strange clairvoyance dwells in all,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And webs the souls of human kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would that I could learn its thrall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And know the power of mind on mind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I then might quickly use the sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To find where one I worship dwells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If in the city, or if thence<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Among the breeze-rung lily bells.<br /></span>

WHAT ONE FINDS IN THE COUNTRY.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I went out in the country<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To spend an idle day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the flowers in blossom,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And scent the fragrant hay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The dawn's spears smote the mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upon their shields of blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And space, in her black valleys,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Joined in the conflict too.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The clouds were jellied amber;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The crickets in the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blew pipe and hammered tabor,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And laughed to see me pass.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The cows down in the pasture,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The mowers in the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds that sang in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Their happiness revealed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My heart was light and joyful,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I could not answer why;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I thought that it was better<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Always to smile than sigh.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How could I hope to meet her<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whom most I wished to meet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If always I had lost her,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then life were incomplete.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The road ran o'er a brooklet;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upon the bridge she stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wild flowers in her ringlets,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And in her hand her hood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The morn laid on her features<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An envious golden kiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She might have fancied truly,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I longed to share its bliss.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I said, "O, lovely maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I have sought you many a day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I love you, love you, love you,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is all that I can say."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her mournful eyes grew brighter,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And archly glanced, though meek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bacchanalian dimple<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dipt a wine-cup in her cheek.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If you love me, love me, love me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If you love me as you say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must prove it, prove it, prove it!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And she lightly turned away.<br /></span>

AN AUNT AND AN UNCLE.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have but an aunt and an uncle<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For kinsfolk on the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one has passed me unnoticed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And hated me from my birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the first has reared me and taught me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whatever I have of worth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is my uncle by marriage,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For his wife my aunt had died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left him all her possessions,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With much that was mine beside&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><span class="i0">'Tis said that he hated her brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As much as he loved the bride.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That brother, my father, forgave him,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As his last hour ran its sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And begged in return his forgiveness,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As he placed in his sister's hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bonds, that when I was twenty,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Should be at my command.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For my mother was dead, God rest her,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I would be left alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bride to her trust was unfaithful&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her heart was harder than stone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her widowed sister, left childless,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Adopted me as her own.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So we dwelt in opposite houses&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We in a dwelling low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he in a brown stone mansion.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I toiled and my gain was slow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My uncle rode in a carriage<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As fine as there was in the row.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once, in a useless anger,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With courage not mine before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bearded the crafty lion,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Demanding my own, no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said the law gave me nothing,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And showed me out of his door.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This is the place, this is the hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the shine, or through the shower,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She promised she would come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, darling day, she is so sweet<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though but a month has passed as yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It seems almost a year.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O, now she comes, and here she stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives me hers in both my hands,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She eyes askance her simple gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And folds a Judas tatter down<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She has not seen till now.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I said, "My love you made me wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I grew almost disconsolate<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thinking you would not come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, tell me what you have to do,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Father and mother both are dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sell sweet flowers to earn my bread&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Their fragrance is my wine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sometimes the house upon the farm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes the city's friendly arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shields me from rain and dew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did not know that it was late;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The minutes you have had to wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are truly but a few."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A smile shone through her large dark eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sometimes, in the stormy skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The light puts through an arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, spreading glory far and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draws the broad curtain cloud aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Making the whole earth warm.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She took my arm; we walked away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw, in parks, the fountains play;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My heart was all elate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I scarcely noticed when I stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my dear waif of womanhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beside our lowly gate.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Spoke Ruth; but when the sunset came, and she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went from the house again to walk alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dead bee glittered gem-like in her hair.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The next day, Richard Wain, when riding past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard Ruth's bird-voice trilling in the lane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caught a glimpse of her between the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A picture, for an instant, in a frame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought, "The prize I coveted is near;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span><span class="i0">She will be mine before the set of sun."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning soon, toward the house he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strode to the door, calling for Dalton Earl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told him for what merchandise he came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The girl was not for sale, the other said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You talk at random now," said Richard Wain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You know I hold the deed of all your lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, unless you let the woman go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your whole estate shall have a sheriff's sale."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The planter turned a coward at the threat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knowing well what blood ran in the veins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her he sold, reluctant gave consent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Above his wine he told Ruth of her fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the floor she fell, and swooned away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recovering, she rose upon her knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And begged, and prayed, that she might still remain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this he told her how the lands were held,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if she went not he must starve or beg.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Then let the lands be sold, and sold again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If his, they are not yours. What good will come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I do go to him? then all is his.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last night I gave my hand to Karagwe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, it will break my heart to go away."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lightly his mustache twirled Dalton Earl.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At dusk, in tears to Karagwe's low roof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruth passed, and uttered, with wild, angry words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hard conditions that had been imposed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wept; he comforted: "There yet was hope:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><span class="i0">There was a Hero, in a Book he read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who said that those who suffered would be blessed."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then for the last, toward the planter's house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They walked, and o'er them saw the spider moon<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But Karagwe, when once he turned again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote wildly his infuriated breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fierce eyes flashed; he thirsted for revenge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came a calmer mood, and far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sped the expelled thoughts like shuddering gusts of wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wept that this injustice should be done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet knew that in God's hand the scale was set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though His poor, down-trodden, waited long,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A poniard glistened. Then the negro rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caught the weapon from the assassin's grasp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood before the planter, Dalton Earl!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Forgive," he said, "Forgiveness is a slave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has no pride, she never does an ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she is meekly great, and nobly good,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rebuked, the master stood before the slave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Richard Wain passed on, nor knew his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was saved by one that he had that day wronged.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Dalton Earl: "I thank you for this act,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thwarting a bad intent. Yet I had cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take the sullied life of Richard Wain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drugged the wine he gave me at his house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knowing that I had with me the deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And title of my lands, begged me to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while I played, stake all upon a card.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He won, and I have hated from that hour."<br /></span>

THE MAIDEN OF THE GOLDEN KIOSK.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the days when I, a beggar, wandered idly through the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Past the palace, through the vineyards where the scented fountains play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing near the golden kiosk, it befell my lot to meet<br /></span>
<span class="i1">One for whom my heart grew larger, and I could not turn away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long my eyes upon the banquet of her beauty freely fed;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How could I help but love her, whom the angels might adore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at last, tired of my staring, she turned away her head;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet I saw the large pearls tremble that about her neck she wore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Either cheek was sea-shell tinted, and around her dewy lips<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Played a smile that lingered lovingly, like star gleam on the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus emboldened, on my knees I fell, and kissed her finger tips,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And begged of her, and prayed of her that I her slave might be.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I was dark and swarthy featured, comely still in form and face;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My long black hair hung glossily about my neck and head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My large jet eyes were lustrous, and I had an easy grace<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That almost made a kingly robe my ragged garb of red.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I chained the maiden with my arm, I would not let her go;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She said she was Eudocia, that Yorghi was her sire;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">But 'neath my heart's one crucible love lit its fusing fire.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her sensuous long dark lashes hung above her dreamy eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like twin clouds of stormy portent balanced over limpid deeps;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the wings of birds of passage seen against the hazy skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like the petal o'er the pollen of the flow'ret when it sleeps.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All her vesture was embroidered with the finest lace of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A diamond in her turban with its eye-like glitter shone;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span><span class="i0">The white dress more than half revealed a form of perfect mould,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And her cincture, dagger-fastened, shaped the garment to her zone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To my eyes she gave her dark eyes, down to gaze into and dream;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I seemed like one who leans above a bridge's slender rail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thinks, and gazes wistfully deep down into the stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While the twilight gathers round him, and the gleam-winged stars prevail.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">After this I met her daily in the palace-garden ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And she always came to meet me, and opened wide the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often chiding, often smiling at my minute-long delays,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And bringing dainty viands in a golden cup and plate.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I, her lover, was a beggar, but she loved me all the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Had I been Haroun Alraschid she could not have loved me more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While she whispered, on my lips and on my eyes she kissed my name,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And vined her arms about my neck; how could I but adore?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">If it cloys, we calmly leave it, with perhaps a careless frown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or may be a pleasant memory that is easy to forget.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once when in the golden kiosk, with Eudocia's hand in mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Came old Yorghi frowning darkly with the storm upon his face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would she bring disgrace upon him? Would she break his noble line?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He stamped his fierce invective, and he drove me from the place.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ere I went I turned upon him, and I boldly claimed her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And vowed that I would have her, though the city barred my way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he scoffed at me, a beggar, and repeated his command,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Never more to meet his daughter, for my life's sake, from that day.<br /></span>

THE SPIDER.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With day-break came a knuckle at my door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rose, and opened, and upon the porch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face like strange death's, and his dark eyes wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some vague horror, stood the fisherman.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come, hasten with me," were his only words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We ran our best along the barren shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gained his silent cottage. Entering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He led me to his daughter's vacant couch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The room had but one window, and the sash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was raised. I looked out to the ground beneath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vine crept up, and with long fingers made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abode secure upon the cottage side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the window threw a leafy scarf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what was this, that fastened to the ledge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trailed to the ground? A glutinous rope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twisted with five strands. This the fisherman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw with new horror, while between white lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gasped, "The Spider!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">What was best to do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw strange foot-prints on the moistened beach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But these were lost soon in a wooded dell<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span><span class="i0">Where all trace had an end. The long day through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sought among the tombs, up from the dell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But unrewarded, when the sun was quenched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat down to weep. So darkness dropped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like an awful spider, o'er the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crawled with gaunt legs of shadow. Then our homes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sadly sought, to meet again at morn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The night was warm, and with my window raised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sat and mourned, and wrung my hopeless hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No light was in the house. I half reclined&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My back toward the window. Something shut<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The puny sheen of starlight from the room.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Thing, a monstrous shape, was with me there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two hard arms were thrown about my waist.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For very terror I was hushed, nor moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cast my foe off. I was in the arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the strong spider. As we went, I grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad, for I thought that now I should be brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the great spider's web, and there, mayhap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learn the sad fate of her I loved so well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up a stark cliff we went, then crossed the web<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as the red moon bloomed upon the hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silvered all the Panticapean vale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The funnel of the web was in the mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a vast tomb, whose outside, hewn on rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outlined a Gorgon's face with jaws agape&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some stern Medusa, Stheno, or Euryale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed to the stone that in the elder days<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span><span class="i0">She changed the sons of men who looked on her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We passed the funnel, entering the tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About my arms the spider threw his cords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shackled them. I dared not move, but lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the smooth stone floor, inured to fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fancied now that I was safe till dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I could use my hands I then might find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some weapon of defense, some club, or stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so resist with some small chance for life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thought bred strength. I slowly drew my arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my sides, and, with persistence, gained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their freedom; though about the wrists, the flesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was bruised and harrowed, and my blood made wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spider's cord wherewith I had been bound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The night seemed endless. As it came to dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A faint moan woke an echo in the tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The echo seemed a cry of pity, sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For solace to the moan. As light grew strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw, not far from where I had been laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maiden sitting. All her hair set free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She made of it a pillow as she leaned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the painted wall. My heart threw wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her my arms, his hospitable doors;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guest within, at once the doors were shut.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sun came up, and spread a cloth of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the sea. We saw the vale beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there the town, and fancied where, among<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trees upon the shore, her cottage stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hoped 'gainst hope to enter it again.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span><span class="i0">Two thousand years ago, this distant sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teemed with the thrifty commerce of the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Athens was, and when her scholars cut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thoughts of iron, their own deathless names<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the stone page of fame, this vale beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held a great city. These, its tombs, endure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no better scoff at the parade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vanity of life, than that a tomb suggests.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While we looked forth on the historic view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw the subtle spider throw his cord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over an eagle tangled in the web.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eagle fought, not mildly overcome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spread his wings, and darted his sharp beak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the spider caught him by the neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his serrated claws that grew like horns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And killed him; then plucked the vanquished plumes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sucked the warm blood from the sundered ends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this we knew the monster brought us here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To serve a hideous banquet, and that one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must need be near, and see the other slain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The web was like the sail of some large ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reached forth from the Gorgon's open mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On either side, to boughs of blighted trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Birds were caught in it, and about the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein the spider hid to watch for prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bones lay bleaching in the sun and rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the web the winds laid violent hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tugged at it, but lacked the sinewed strength<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span><span class="i0">To tear it or divorce it from its place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rain left on it when the sun came up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dyed the vast cloth with all prismatic hues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made it glitter like the silken sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cleopatra's barge.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">We felt quite sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eagle's death bequeathed new lease of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cast about at once, in hope to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some object for defense. The tomb was strange.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone the spider could have known of it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rich sarcophagus stood in the midst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of deftly inlaid woods, or carved, or bronzed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within, a skeleton, its white skull crowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gold bestarred with diamonds, chilled my blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bronze lamp, cast to represent the beast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slain by Bellerophon, the Chim&aelig;ra,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was on the floor; and from its lion's mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flame had issued, like the flame of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flickered and went out with him gold-crowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A target stood near by, and on it clashed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griffon and stag, adverse as right and wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About, lay cups of onyx set in gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On conic jars were bacchanalian scenes,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nude chubby Bacchi, grotesque leering fauns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All linked 'neath vines that grew important grapes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the jars were rings and flowers of gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We found twin ear-drops cut from choicest stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Metallic mirrors, and a statuette<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of amorous Dido naked to the waist.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span><span class="i0">Life is a harp, and all its nervous strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touched by the fingers of the fear of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jar with pathetic music. Having found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No trusty implement to bar the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of threatening peril, we embraced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed with silent kisses mixed with tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waited for the end.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">When no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope, like an eagle in the mountain air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soars in time's future, it mounts up with wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the unmapped city walled by death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither the eagle of our hope took flight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sun was in the zenith. His back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward us, crouched the spider, at the mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our strange prison on the towering cliff.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spider's shape was full a fathom long.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two parts it had, the fore part, head and breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hinder part, the trunk. The first was black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the last was covered with short hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yellow and fine. Eight sprawling legs adhered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his tough breast. Eight eyes were in his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two in the front, and three on either side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had no eyelids, and were never closed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Protected by a strong transparent nail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pincers grew between his foremost eyes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were toothed like saws, were venomous, and sharp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With claws on either end. Two arms stretched out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his mailed shoulders, and with these he caught<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span><span class="i0">His tangled prey, or guided what he spun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly the monster turned, and glared at us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Working his arms, and opening his claws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then moved toward us fiercely for attack.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We ran to gain the limit of the tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where darkness was; there as we crouched with dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My foot struck some hard substance. In despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I grasped at it, and with great joy upheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient sword!&mdash;surely, a sharp, bold tooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bite the spider. I would sink it deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the gum of the crossed guard. Alert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sprang upon the monster as he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with one blow cut off his brutish head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He writhed awhile with pain, but in the end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew up the eight long legs and two thick arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rolling over on his useless back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Died with a pang.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">So we issued forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the green earth seemed happy to be free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad the sky cloud-frescoed 'gainst the blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sought the sea-side cottage, where the chief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clasped once again his daughter to his breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down from the hill we fetched the spider slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I to science gave these simple facts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spiders have no antenn&aelig;, therefore rank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not with the insects. As they breathe with gills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the body, they possess a heart.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span><span class="i0">The treasure of the tomb brought wealth to us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we who loved were wed one golden day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the great Czar hearing our story told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent presents to the bride of silk and pearls.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A handsome face whatever be its sins:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A firm mouth, with large wandering black eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bearded under-lip, and snowy teeth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long, fine black hair, which idly falls about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoulders that stoop from labor over books;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withal a high and intellectual brow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A stranger in the dell she loves the most,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He has not seen such beauty in his life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He craves to touch a finger of her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To judge if she be of the earth, or one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon some holy mission from that land<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She makes her ears his cells for honeyed speech;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The wide half-door which now is opened half&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he passes down the bordered path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His kiss still lingering upon her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She leans out from the door, and watches him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until he vanishes between the trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seem to see her face, a trouble sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwelling upon it, even though the light<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gianni comes, and stops a moody hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, ice to his approaches; he, despair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere he goes, he places in her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A large ripe orange, fresh from Sicily,<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span><span class="i0">She bows him from the room, and puts the fruit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before her on her music, once again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreaming of me, and singing some wild song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pan, who, by the river straying down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut reeds, and blew upon them with such power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He charmed the lilies and the dragon-flies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now while the song is swaying to its close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seem to come myself into the room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clasp true arms about my darling Grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lays Gianni's orange in my hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And says that I must eat it; she would not<br /></span>

THE KING'S SEAL.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">While</span> yet upon his couch our father lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sick unto death, my brothers, with one mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plotted abrupt destruction to my life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did not tell the king, because I feared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lessen by one heat the throbbing of his heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside his couch I knelt, and bowed my head&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, his first-born, whom all the people loved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hot, weak hand he laid upon my hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blessed me with his blessing, then said on:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou hast beheld in Spring the dark green blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stabs up through the unresisting earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the Summer crowns it with a flower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thou, when I am passed away, and gone to dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt wear a crown, but grander than the shrubs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The symbol of a kingdom, on thy brow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But take thee now this lesson to thy heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the grass learn wisdom; wear thy crown<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With careless garb, and heavy hairy brows<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My will was lost in his. I grew like him.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And he it was who, standing in the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between two pillars on the palace porch,<br /></span>

THE NIGHT OF THE ESCAPE.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The night before the murder was to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I drew my long, keen dagger from its sheath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stole on down the marble stair-way, past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throne-room, to the curtained arch wherein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My brothers lay asleep. No dream beset<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guilty Dead-Sea of their rest. They lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Engulfed in pillows, like two ships mid waves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw their faces, and the one was fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long dark brown hair fell from his noble brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the silken billow of the couch lay curled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like spray. The other face was cold and dark<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span><span class="i0">I felt no pity in my angry breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this, the older brother of the twain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he it was who always praised me most.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Praise is a dust of diamond that, if thrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well in the eyes of even noble men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will blind them to a host of flagrant faults.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon was full, and 'twixt two silvered clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked forth, like any princess from between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tasseled curtains of her downy bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vagrant wind came through the opened blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whispered of the desert; with its hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fanning the flame that in the silver urn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mimicked a star. Beneath the rays I wrote:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="italic">I should have slain you both for your intent</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="italic">Of murder; but I spare, you, and I go.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="italic">So, take the kingdom, and ride long and well.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between them there I laid the paper down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thrust my dagger, to the golden hilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through it, deep in the couch. So passing on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came to that high room wherein my sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king, lay sick, and drifting near to death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My tutor at his feet, and on the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embraced by needed sleep, lay like a dog.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came to see the king's face once again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere, like a maid who in her lover trusts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gave myself up, body and soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the great desert and the world beyond.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sweetly slept the king! His long white beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And venerable face, were undisturbed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By even the breezy motion of his breath.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span><span class="i0">Surely, I thought, the fever must have passed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bent down tenderly to kiss the cheek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How cold! God help me, can the king be dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart gave one wild bound, driving a wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of grief, vast as a mountain, up the sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my bleak desolation. The wave broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a blinding mist of tears at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I longed to moan out my despair, but paused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Checking my sobs to kiss the face once more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then moved from the strange room, parting with care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The massive silken curtains, fearful then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their rustle might attract some wakeful ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found the jewels of the crown, and these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all my own I in a bag secured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung about my neck, beneath my robe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noiseless as a ghost I passed the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down the stair-way wrought of sandal-wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made lightest footsteps. As I stole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the alcoves where the maidens slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lady stood before me. She outstretched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her white and naked arms, and round my neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entwined them. She was the captive, Veera,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once held for ransom from some Bedouin tribe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the coin was brought she would not go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this the king was pleased, for thus she made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perpetual peace between him and her kin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No maid in Mesched up and down, was found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rival her for beauty. All her words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were apt and good, and all her ways were sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, in her happy prison, ivory-barred<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span><span class="i0">By her white arms, was restless for release.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would not set me free until I told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The purport of my vigil, and revealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place whereat my journey would be done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did not wait to pay her back her kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hurried to the stables, where I found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My coal-black steed. He neighed and pawed the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bound the saddle firmly, grasped the reins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a moment passed the city's gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shot out on the desert, where the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made race with us, but lagged behind at last.<br /></span>

TWO PROBLEMS.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vienna gained, I gave myself to books.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here I had promised Veera I should be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New paths were opened to me, and my days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were lost in study. All my tutor knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed cramped and meagre in these wider ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thought and science. Better far, I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know, than be a king. There is no crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so becomes the brow as knowledge does.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To solve two problems, now engrossed my life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Bedouin tutor had spent all his days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon them, but without success. On me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He grafted all the purpose of his soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Determined, though he failed, that I might yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toil on when he was compassed round by death.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span><span class="i0">These sister problems were, <span class="italic">How make pure gold?</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, <span class="italic">How endure forever on the earth?</span><br /></span>

THE DOOR.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Among the books that I had bought myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found the Bible. This to peruse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I soon essayed; but ere I had read far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold! I found the door behind which lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The answers to my problems. Locked and barred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door was, yet I knew it was the door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For here I read of Eden, and that in the midst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tree of Life stood, while through the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A river ran which parted in four heads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one was Gihon, the Ethiop stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one was Pison, the great crystal tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which floods Havilah, where fine gold is found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rare bdellium and the onyx stone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, as my tutor said, my problems were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dual secret, and the one contained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other. All the long night through I pored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the words, and kissed the unconscious page<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With reverent lips. My heart was like a sponge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soaked in the water of the mystic words.<br /></span>

THE KEY.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As one who in the night, passing a street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserted, finds a lost key rusted and old,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet knows that it will fit some great iron door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind which countless treasures are concealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I, when first I came to Mesmer's works,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew I had found the key to move the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my twin problems. Then, day after day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I made them all my study. Much I mourned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sad disheartened life that Mesmer led.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never knew that one good thing, success;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet his strong, persistent genius, to the end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endured. Yet such the rule in every age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one true man appears, and gives his thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At which the whole world rail or basely sneer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next man comes and makes a thankless use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what the other knew, and wins the praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first man lost by being ripe too soon.<br /></span>

NEWS FROM MESCHED.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Down the long street, upon my iron-black steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rode and pondered. Where shall I seek to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sweet soul pure as dawn, who to my will shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both malleable and ductile; who can soar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the whole earth, or go back in the past?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet I mused, lo, up a garden walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lady chased a bird. An empty cage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood in the vine-clad cottage-window near.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bird was like some sweet elusive thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid, a Sappho, weary with pursuit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She only glanced my way to see me pass,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span><span class="i0">Then turned and ran towards me, her large eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gladness scintillant. It was the maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veera. Her hand upon my shoulder, up the walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We went, my steed following, while her bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tired of his liberty, had found his cage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange news had Veera. Here she lived in peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But through the city she had sought me long.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I was gone from Mesched, and my brothers read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The paper I had written, their wrath rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against my tutor whom they deemed the spy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, being found asleep beside the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lay dead, to his door they brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The baseless charge of murder. Through the streets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sent their criers to proclaim the deed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, clamorous for his life, the people came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dragged him forth, and led him to the block<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slew him. On a spear they set his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And placed it high upon the tower above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eastern gate. The birds pecked at the eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the hair made comfortable nests.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rain beat on it, and the active wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowned it with desert dust. Always the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made salutation to it, flushing it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until it seemed more ghastly than before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But after this mad crime the older brother grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jealous of him, the younger. One dark morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They found the last-born lifeless in the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stabbed by a long, sharp poniard in the back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misrule followed misrule, and justice fled.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span><span class="i0">Laws were abolished, and pleasure's lewdest voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hawked in the market-place, and through the streets.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her story done, Veera entreated me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To set my face for Mesched with the dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Not yet," I said, "not yet." And then I made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange passes with my hands, and braced my will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sway her will; then with a questioning glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She passed out to a calm Mesmeric sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, well I knew that I had found the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My purpose needed, and I bade her wake.<br /></span>

THE MIDNIGHT VISITOR.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I sat and pondered in my room that night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the towers and steeples, near and far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like sentries of the sky, issued the hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of midnight. Then I wrought magnetic force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With waving hands; and set my swerveless will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Veera should approach me, and that none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should harm or see her as she passed the streets.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last I heard her footstep on the stair&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The patter of her feet as soft as rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then she turned the hinge and entered in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long white wrapper made of satin, bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lace of gold, and fastened at the throat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With buttons of cut diamond, clad her form.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A band of opals was around her neck&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred little worlds with central fires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her feet were naked, and her hair was down.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span><span class="i0">Her large eyes, wide and staring, took no heed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of anything before them; thus she slept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bade her sit beside me, and I placed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bible on her knee, and laid her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the verse that names the tree of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Tell me," I said, "where may this tree be found."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The way is long," she answered me at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And I am worn and weary. I have tracked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shore of one long river, many a mile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun scorches like fire. I am athirst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot find the tree; my search is done."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Look down the past, and find if any knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where grows this tree, or how it might be found."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again her lips made answer: "One I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long dead, who bends above a written scroll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therein makes strange characters, which hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some hidden sense pertaining to this tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Milan, in the Ambrosian library there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see this scroll to-night; 'tis worn with age."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now seek thy home again," I said, "sweet soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art as meek and pure as him whose hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First wrote God's words." So she arose, and passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the dark, deserted street, and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed her closely, till I saw her cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The threshold of her cottage; then I turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found my home, and calmly slept till dawn.<br /></span>

THE PALIMPSEST.</h3>

<span class="i0">In Milan, in the Ambrosian library there,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And on the margin of this scroll, I found<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Back to Vienna came and found Veera.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her I made my double purpose plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prayed her to go with me in my search.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She smiled assent. To be near me, she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had brought her to Vienna; this indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Detained her from her kinsmen. Her heart's book<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay open to me, and I read her love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we were wed, and both lives ran to one.<br /></span>

GIHON.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now for the Nile we journeyed, gaining first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The town of Gondokoro, where the stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Bahr el Abiad, or White Nile, flows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence we passed on, and with the savage kings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Karagwe, Uganda and Ungoro, stopped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rest our weary feet, or in their huts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Escape the sun's fierce glare. At last we found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sources of the Nile; two lakes that now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are called Nyanza and Nzige. If here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had but paused, and had retraced my steps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole world would have known and praised my name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I was first to find the secret out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then I cared not for it, journeying on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After a week, we came upon a land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All void, and barren of a single leaf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veera was pale and worn, although she bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fatigue with generous patience for my sake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our feet were swollen, and with the hot sand scorched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our garments were in tatters, and we seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like beggars, in a land where there were none to give.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At night we slept beside a wide, cool stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat we quenched our thirst, and bathed our feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My beard was grown, and all my hair hung down<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span><span class="i0">Neglected, on my shoulders. I was weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thin, and feverish, and Veera, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw was sick, and languished hour by hour.<br /></span>

GOLD!</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the sand, lo! something to the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied with brilliant lustre; as I brushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dust away, I saw that it was gold!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A solid bar of gold&mdash;and yet so weak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was I, I could not move it from its place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would have given then the bar of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To buy a crust, but could not. So we passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came where five great rivers went their ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which should we follow? One I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led to the tree of life, but all the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went back to death. Here a dead bird we found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tearing off its gaudy plumage, ate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon occasional trees grew strange sparse fruits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these sustained us as we wandered on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the banks for many a mile we went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By each of these five rivers, then returned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So all my hope was dead, and long I prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I might live to see my land again.<br /></span>

THE MESSAGE OF THE THREE MEN.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The night came on, and unto sleep we gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our spirits. When the golden day was born<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span><span class="i0">Veera awoke, and told me all her dream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lo, in the night three men have talked with me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three strange good men who said the kindest words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said that only those who were released<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From sin, could find the garden of the Lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this release was bought upon a cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By One, a Nazarene, with priceless blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If He would bear our sins, then we might reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The garden; but we must not touch or eat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tree of life that flourished in the midst."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I abased my soul, and prayed again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast off all the burden of my sins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tearing my strange ambition from my heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Veera, too, embraced the Christian Faith.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we arose, and went upon our way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And journeying eastward, Eden found at last!<br /></span>

THE GARDEN.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The trees were housed with nests, and every one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was like a city of song. The streams too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were voluble; they laughed and gurgled there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like men who, at a banquet, sit and drink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chatter. All the grass was like a robe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of velvet, and there was no need of rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dells roofed with green leafage, nature spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Couches meet for a Sybarite. Sweet food<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The servant trees extended us to eat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their long, branchy arms. Even the sun<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span><span class="i0">Was tempered, and the sky was always blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Corpulent grapes along the crystal rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made consorts of the long-robed lady leaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The butterfly and bee, from morn till eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consulted with the roses, lip to lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which grew in rank profusion. They at times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dared to invade the empire of the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And overthrew its green-robed, spear-armed hosts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lilies too were like an army there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every night they struck their snowy tents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please their great commander, the round moon&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God's lily in the everlasting sky.<br /></span>

CAST OUT.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As to the heliotrope comes fluttering down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The peacock-butterfly, who sips and flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So each glad day gold-winged came to the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sipped its sip of time and fled away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in an evil hour I hungered, and I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tree of life that grew forbidden fruit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What harm, I thought, is there to always live?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To live is happiness; but to die is pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rental claimed by death falls due too soon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I reached forth, and took the fruit, and ate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all the sky grew dark, and from the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Malignant terrors drove me shrieking forth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as I fled, my youth abandoned me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hair turned gray, my shoulders stooped, my blood<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span><span class="i0">Grew colder, and my perfect form was changed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A weak old man with wrinkled face, I fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wander in the wastes. Once I looked back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the garden; over it the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was soft and clear; and midway in the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw Veera between two angels, borne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heaven. So I turned again and fled.<br /></span>

"LONG LIVE THE KING."</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I came at last to Mesched. It was night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon, half-shadowed, trailed its silver robe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the tower above the eastern gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there revealed the outlines of a skull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set on a spear. The portals were unbarred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I passed the arch, but in the shadow kept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While on the flinty wall I edged my knife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I crept on until I gained the porch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the great palace. There I smote the guard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And entering in, sought out the sleeping king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in his heart I plunged my thirsty knife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the next day I sat before the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And begged, and heard the rumors of the town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, standing forth, I claimed to be their king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told them all my story to the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None pitied the dead ruler, for he knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No pity while he lived. So I was king at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all my life, and all my hope to me<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span><span class="i0">Are dust and ashes, knowing that God's frown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abides upon me. Would that I could die!<br /></span>
